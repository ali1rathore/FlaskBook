# FlaskBook

This is a Python web application designed to let users archive and view media (stories, images etc.) from a variety of
sources (eg. [Reddit](https://reddit.com) and [Imgur](https://imgur.com)).

This is my first foray into a Python project and is meant to act as a personal learning experience. There is no
particular practical application I'm working towards.
